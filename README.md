# Gossip-Simulator
The goal of the project is to determine the convergence of Gossip type algorithms through a simulator based on actor written in Elixir. Gossip Algorithm for information propagation and Push Sum Algorithm for sum computation were implemented in various network topologies like Full, Line, 3D torus, Random 2D Grid and Honeycomb.
